## How does a model relate to a test in GraphWalker?

A GraphWalker model consists of 2 types of basic elements, the `vertex` and the `edge`.

#### **An edge represents an action, a transition.**<br>
An action could be an API call, a button click, a timeout, etc. Anything that moves your System Under Test into a new state that you want to verify. But remember, there is no verification going on in the edge. That happens only in the vertex.

#### **A vertex represents verification, an assertion.**<br>
A verification is where you would have assertions in your code. It is here that you verify that an API call returns the correct values, that a button click actually did close a dialog, or that when the timeout should have occurred, the System Under Test triggered the expected event.

#### **A model is a graph, which is a set of vertices and edges**<br>
From a model, GrapWalker will generate a path through it. A model has a `start element`, and a `generator` which rules how the path is generated, and associated `stop condition` which tells GraphWalker when to stop generating the path.
