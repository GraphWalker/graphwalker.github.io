## The feature set of GraphWalker

### Path generation

* From a given set of models(graphs), generators and stop conditions, GraphWalker will generate a path through them.  
  Only when all stop conditions for all generators in all models are fulfilled, the generation of the path is done.
  
* The path represents your tests, or test cases if you wish.  
  The path can be used by your tests to call the corresponding methods or functions in the order that is determined by the path.

* The path is a sequence of elements which represents pairs of edges and vertices.  
  It's like a test script, where an action is always followed by a verification.  
  The path is like:  

  |Step|Label           |Element type|
  |----|----------------|------------|
  |1   |Do something    |Edge        |
  |2   |Verify something|Vertex      |
  |3   |Do something    |Edge        |
  |4   |Verify something|Vertex      |
  |5   |Do something    |Edge        |
  |6   |Verify something|Vertex      |
  |:   |:               |:           |

* An edge represents an action or a transition.  

  An action could be an API call, a button clicked, a timeout etc. 
  Anything that moves your System Under Test into a new state that you want to verify. 
  But remember, there is no verification going on in the edge. That happens only in the vertex. 

* A vertex represents a verification.  

  A verification is where you would have assertions in your code. 
  It's where you verify that an API call returns the correct values. 
  That a button click actually did close a dialog. 
  Or that when the timeout should have occurred, the System Under Test triggered the expected event.

### Offline generation

<a download="example_1.graphml" href="/content/resources/example_1.graphml"><img src="/images/example_1.png" alt="Model" align="right"/></a>

The path generation is done once. 
The path needs to be stored in some intermediate format. 
Typically, the path is generated from [command line](/cli-offline/), and the output stored on file. 
The content of the file is then would be used by you for manual test execution or in test automation to drive a test.

**Example**

Given the following graph [example_1.graphml](/content/resources/example_1.graphml), 
a path can be generated by running a command from a terminal. 
Below is an example of a generated path from that graph using a random path generator with an edge coverage stop condition. 
The test will start at the element `app_closed`


```
java -jar graphwalker-cli-3.4.2.jar offline --start-element app_closed --model example_1.graphml "random(edge_coverage(100))"
{"currentElementName":"app_closed"}
{"currentElementName":"start_app"}
{"currentElementName":"app_running"}
{"currentElementName":"close_app"}
{"currentElementName":"app_closed"}
{"currentElementName":"start_app"}
{"currentElementName":"app_running"}
{"currentElementName":"open_preferences"}
{"currentElementName":"display_preference"}
{"currentElementName":"close_preferences"}
{"currentElementName":"app_running"}

```

To make the output only print out the element names, we can use the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) command, and run following instead:

```
java -jar graphwalker-cli-3.4.2.jar offline --start-element app_closed --model example_1.graphml "random(edge_coverage(100))" | jq -r '.currentElementName'
app_closed
start_app
app_running
close_app
app_closed
start_app
app_running
open_preferences
display_preference
close_preferences
app_running

```

### Online generation

<a download="ShoppingCart.graphml" href="/content/resources/ShoppingCart.graphml"><img src="/images/amazonShoppingCart_small.png" alt="Model" align="right"/></a>

The path generation is done during the execution of the test, run-time. 
This means that GraphWalker needs to be embedded in your test automation code. 
This adds a bit of complexity, but the advantages are:

* No need to handle the intermediate path sequences in files.<br>{: style=""}

  If your test automation is written in Java, it's pretty straight forward. You annotate a Java class with `@GraphWalker`.<br>
  The class represents your graph, and methods in that class represents elements in that graph. 
  Using [maven](https://maven.apache.org/), running the test with GraphWalker is done by:

  
  ```
  mvn graphwalker:test
  ```
  
  GraphWalker will call methods in the class during path generation.

* Your test automation code has direct access to the graphs execution context.  

  When GraphWalker generates paths, it keeps all data regarding the generation in an 
  [execution context](https://github.com/GraphWalker/graphwalker-project/blob/b604d282087db9776ebf9c4887a1224dcb642567/graphwalker-core/src/main/java/org/graphwalker/core/machine/ExecutionContext.java). 
  Your test can query for data in your model, and it can even change data in your model.  
  
  An example is the [Amazon example](https://github.com/GraphWalker/graphwalker-example/tree/master/java-amazon). 
  The code at [ShoppingCartTest.java line 65](https://github.com/GraphWalker/graphwalker-example/blob/1c66dc315fd37ca362e66704d26f194bf3acc6bd/java-amazon/src/main/java/org/graphwalker/ShoppingCartTest.java#L65) shows how the current value for the property `num_of_books` is fetched using `getAttribute` from the model.
  
## What GraphWalker does not do

### Management of the system under test

GraphWalker does not interact with your system under test. You need some other tool do that. 
If, for instance, you want to test a web application, you would perhaps use [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) to do that. 
Or, if your target is a mobile app, then [Appium](http://appium.io/) might be your choice.


### Graph editing

Today, the graphs are edited using an external tool called [yEd from yWorks](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed).

A web editor supporting editing of directed graphs is underway, and is expected to be included in the 4.0 release of GraphWalker.
