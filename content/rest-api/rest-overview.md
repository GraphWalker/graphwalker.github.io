GraphWalker can be run as a Restful service. This page is an overview of the API used to
interact with the service.

The service only handles one session at a time. Models can either be uploaded using the [REST load API call](/rest-load/),
or loaded on command line.

## Command line example

Start GraphWalker REST service on default port 8887 with debug level set to ALL.

```
java -jar graphwalker-cli-3.4.2.jar --debug all online --service RESTFUL
```

Start GraphWalker REST service on port 9999 with no debug level.

```
java -jar graphwalker-cli-3.4.2.jar online --service RESTFUL --port 9999
```

Start GraphWalker REST using default port with full debug and a graphml model.

```
java -jar graphwalker-cli-3.4.2.jar -d all online -s RESTFUL -m ShoppingCart.graphml "random(edge_coverage(100))"
```

See more about [command line options here](/cli-online/).
