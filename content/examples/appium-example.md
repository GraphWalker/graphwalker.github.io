This is an example of how to use GraphWalker to test apps using Appium.

## The test

The system under test is a simple android app called Notepad. It is packaged with the test under:

```
src/main/resources/Notepad.apk
```

The test will install the Notepad app to the target device and start running the test.
This model depicts the design of the test.

The code that implements the test:

```
src/main/java/org/graphwalker/appium/NotesListTest.java
```

The `class NotesListTest` implements the `interface NotesList`. That interface is automatically generated by GraphWalker,
by running either of the following commands:

```
mvn graphwalker:generate-sources
mvn graphwalker:test
```

Worth noting in the code is the line with the GraphWalker annotation:

```java
@GraphWalker(value = "random(edge_coverage(100))", start = "v_NotesListView")
```

It does 2 things:

1.  `value = "random(edge_coverage(100))"`<br>
It sets the generator and the stop condition for the path generation of the test. `random(edge_coverage(100))` means
that the path generator is the random path generator, and the stop condition is when all edges of the graph has been visited.
2. `start = "v_NotesListView"`<br>
Tells GraphWalker where to start the execution. `v_NotesListView` will be the first graph element to be executed.

The above is equivalent to running the following in offline mode:

```
java -jar graphwalker-cli-3.4.2.jar offline -m NotesList.graphml "random(edge_coverage(100))"
```

## Steps to execute the project

1. Install appium. On Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt install nodejs-legacy
sudo npm install -g appium
```

2. Start android emulator.<br>
The test is only verified running the Android emulator using Nexus 7, 2012 with API 19. <br>
From command line on a Linux box:

```
emulator -avd Nexus_5X_API_23
```

3. Start appium.
4. Run the test:

```
git clone https://github.com/GraphWalker/graphwalker-example.git
cd graphwalker-example/java-appium
mvn graphwalker:test
```
